Overview:
Lyrics Generation by Genre leverages the power of deep learning to generate song lyrics tailored to specific music genres. 
This project uses PyTorch and Hugging Face's transformers library to fine-tune a generative model, focusing on the unique lyrical styles of various music genres.

Features:
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a GPT-based model fine-tuned for generating lyrics, demonstrating the capability to produce creative content.
Genre Specific Tuning: Extensive experimentation and hyperparameter tuning were conducted to optimize the model for different music genres.
Transformers Library: Implementation using the cutting-edge Hugging Face's transformers for model training and generation.

Technologies Used:
Python/PyTorch: For the backend and model training.
Hugging Face's Transformers: For utilizing pre-trained models and fine-tuning them.

How to Use:

1.Link to the model: https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexchudnovsky/lyrics-generation-gpt2-fine-tuning?scriptVersionId=174106274

2.Then Click on the 3 little circles on the up rightside of the screen and click on “Copy & Edit notebook”.

3.Then click again on the 3 little circles on the up rightside , click on accelerator and choose GPU P100 And click start session .

4.Finally click on the before last block to run the generation wait for Kaggle to download the parameters and then its going to generate the lyrics. 

You have an option to choose an initial prompt , change the prompt parameter To true and then write your prompt in the window that will pop out .
